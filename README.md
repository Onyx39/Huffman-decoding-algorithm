# Huffman-decoding-algorithm-project
This is the Huffman decoding algorithm implemented in Python.
This is one of the projects I am doing as student in Polytech Annecy.

# Requirements
First, you need a compressed text (compressed by the Huffman method) and the alphabet of the text also generated by the Huffman method.

Secondly, you have to create an empty text file (with Notepad for example).

# Before you run the code 
You need to fill the requirements and adapt the 3 paths in the main code to your own machine.

# Results
The program prints some information about the compression rate in the console.
Moreover, it writes the decoded text in your empty file. 
You just have to open it to read the text.
