# Huffman-decoding-algorithm
This is the Huffman decoding algorithm implemented in Python.
This is one of the projects I am doing as student in Polytech Annecy.

# Requirements
First, you need a compressed text (compressed by the Huffman method) and the alphabet of the text generated by the Huffman method too

Secondly, you need to adapt the 3 paths in the src/paths.py file to your own machine.

# Results
The program prints some information about the compression rate in the console and it writes the decoded text in a text file on your machine. You just have to open it to read the text.
